Just some custom configurations that I use on a day-to-day basis
------

The contents here in this repo. serves as a backup for me.

1. karabiner.conf
    Karabiner elements is a very powerful Mac custom keymap software.
    I made this conf, so that I can use a windows keyboard with Mac as per my convenience.
    But at the same time, when I connect to a remote windows machine, the keys behave as they should in windows.

2. some bash configs.
3. SUBLIME TEXT KEYMAP.
